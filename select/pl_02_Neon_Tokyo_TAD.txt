[Verse]
Neon nights
Are in sight
Tokyo drive
That's the vibe
[Chorus]
Are you ready for this city pop
Ridin' through the night till we drop
Are you ready for this city pop
Neon lights will never stop
[Verse]
Synthwave dreams
Unfoldin' themes
Come with me
To this galaxy
[Chorus]
Are you ready for this city pop
Ridin' through the night till we drop
Are you ready for this city pop
Neon lights will never stop
[Bridge]
Are you ready for this city pop
Are you ready for this city pop
Are you ready for this city pop
Are you ready for this city pop
[Chorus]
Are you ready for this city pop
Ridin' through the night till we drop
Are you ready for this city pop
Neon lights will never stop
